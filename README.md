# Aneura Explorations: Graphic Clouds

An object in the series of "graphic art"/"machine learning" explorations. The goal is to generate visually pleasing high resolution images containing word clouds based on the concept chosen by a user.

# The current project consists of:

1. Interactive website which:
  * Accepts user input with the desired "concept" the user would like to map, clarifying keywords, font/background style and output image size.
  * Frontend/backend communication (Javascript to Flask) to update the user on the exact stages of progress.
  * Small in-browser JS game to make waiting process less boring (since generating high resolutiong images may take quite a while)
  * A gallery of examples of the art generated by the script previously.
2. Web-scraper to collect text/image data from Google that corresponds to the chosen "concept". Thus each request potentially may generate a slightly different cloud according to whatever is currently trending/viral.
3. Python script which:
  * Logs the process of the script on the backend to show it to the user on the frontend as the script progresses. 
  * Runs K-means clustering on images obtained from search to get the color scheme and gets rid of either blacks or whites depending on which background is chosen so that there is enough contrast between the text and background.
  * Maps the obtained text and graphic data on the canvas to create a collage around or inside the base 'concept' (displayed as an actual word).
  * Saves everything into a csv format file for future references.
 4. Python notebook to run the script step by step with full control of the settings. Image masks are supported by the script but not on the website because of potential security issues connected with accepting files from users.

# Future development/other projects:

1. Integrate CafePress or similar API to send high-resolution images to be printed by side service.
2. Neural network which will turn any photographs into intricate black and white masks which will later be filled by words to produce high resolution detailed artworks retaining colors of the original image.
